### It has been about 3 months since I started learning React...

With no prior experience on web development. I had to learn everything from the basics like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

After brushing up on those fundamentals, I dove deep into React with tutorials on YouTube by channels like Web Dev Simplified and Code With Mosh.

🚀 My favorite one was Ben Awad's tutorial on Practical React because he explains it really briefly and covers a lot of nuances about React

### 🙌 As of now, I've pretty much gotten used to these skills & technologies:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Vercel
- Netlify
- MongoDB
- Firebase
- Express
- NodeJS
- MySQL
- ... and more to come!

### ✍ At time of writing, I'm planning to learn more about:

- Redux
- MobX
- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
- Supabase
- Deno
- Socket.io & Web Sockets
- Chakra UI
- Ant Design
- Docker
- JEST
